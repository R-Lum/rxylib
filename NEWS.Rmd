## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This version has C++17 as a system requirement.**

* `read_xyData()` no throws more meaningful errors if the underlying library throws 
errors.
* Update `xrdml.cpp` to work with nodes of type "counts" instead of "intensities"
