## Changes in version 0.2.12 (2023-11-03)

**This version has C++17 as a system requirement.**

- `read_xyData()` now throws more meaningful errors if the underlying
  library throws errors.
- Update `xrdml.cpp` to work with nodes of type “counts” instead of
  “intensities” (depending on what is available)
